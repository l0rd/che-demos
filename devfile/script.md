# Devfile Demo

## Introduction

Devfile is a new format for defining a development environment, aka Che Workspace.
It's a straightforward and declarative format and `chectl` provides easy way to start using it.
`chectl` is able to generate devfile for live application. Then generated devfile can be put into
sources code repository to make it reusable on any Che installation.

## Setup (before running the demo)

1. Create minishift/minikube VM
    - Demo is tested with minishift VM with 8GB memory allocated
2. Deploy Che Server to local cluster

      ```bash
      chectl server:start [-p minishift]
      #export EDITOR=vim
      kubectl edit -n che cm/che # add CHE_WORKSPACE_SIDECAR_IMAGE__PULL__POLICY: "IfNotPresent"
      kubectl scale --replicas=0 deployment/che
      kubectl scale --replicas=1 deployment/che
      ```

3. Modify `deploy_k8s.yaml` to match VM's IP address in ingress:
    - `sed -i "s/192.168.99.100/$(minikube ip)/g" ./deploy_k8s.yaml`
4. Deploy NodeJS application using [deploy_k8s.yaml](deploy_k8s.yaml)

  ```bash
  kubectl create namespace nodejs-app
  kubectl apply -n nodejs-app -f deploy_k8s.yaml
  ```

   And then check that application is available on `http://nodejs.$(minikube ip).nip.io/`
6. Install tested binaries of `chectl` https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1zz8mNfYl-cPmVUP0SJVd4tf34ePdb9ed?usp=sharing
7. Run through demo once or cache all images for a smoother experience

## Script (timing ~15 minutes)

1. Demonstrate NodeJS sample application
  - Demonstrate that you have NodeJS sample application that uses mongo for storing data https://github.com/sleshchenko/NodeJS-Sample-App
  - Demonstrate that you have this application deployed on Kubernetes/OpenShift with dashboard (deployments, services, ingresses, PVCs)
  - Demo that application works fine but there is a bug, it's not possible to remove employee.
    Application should be available at http://nodejs.$(minishift ip).nip.io/
- Demonstrate Devfile
  - Use `chectl devfile:generate` command to generate Devfile:
    ```bash
    chectl devfile:generate \
      --namespace='nodejs-app' \
      --selector='app.kubernetes.io/name=employee-manager' \
      --git-repo='https://github.com/sleshchenko/NodeJS-Sample-App.git' \
      --language=typescript > generated.devfile.yaml
    ```
  - Demonstrate generated [Devfile](generated.devfile.yaml)
- Customize generated Devfile to be able to start developing
  - Make kubernetes component alias simpler, remove `app.kubernetes.io/name=` and leave only `employee-manager`
  - Override NodeJS container entrypoint not to start an application from the beginning.
    The following fields should be added to `web-app` container
    ```yaml
      command: ["tail"]
      args: ["-f", "/dev/null"]
    ```
  - Configure a commands to build, run and stop an application
    Add the following section to Devfile
    ```yaml
      commands:
      - name: run
        actions:
          - type: exec
            component: employee-manager
            command: cd ${CHE_PROJECTS_ROOT}/NodeJS-Sample-App.git/EmployeeDB && node app.js
      - name: stop
        actions:
          - type: exec
            component: employee-manager
            command: pkill node
    ```
  - *Alternatively*, show diff between generated devfile and `ready-to-use.devfile.yml`, explaining differences
- Fix the bug
  - Start a workspace from modified [Devfile](ready-to-use.devfile.yaml)
    - `chectl workspace:start --devfile=ready-to-use.devfile.yaml`
  - Find and fix the bug in source code: `_` is missing before `id` in delete method
  - Run application with run task and follow Theia instructions to access your application
  - Demonstrate that the application is updated and bug is fixed
- Share Devfile
  - Add the Devfile to NodeJS application sources
  - Modify the Devfile to reference deploy_k8s.yaml and override entrypoint instead of containing all k8s objects
    Replace `referenceContent` kubernetes component with the following fields:
    ```yaml
      reference: deploy_k8s.yaml
      entrypoints:
      - containerName: web-app
      command: ["tail"]
      args: ["-f", "/dev/null"]
    ```
  - Create a workspace with factory by Github URL http://che-che.192.168.99.100.nip.io/f?url=https://github.com/sleshchenko/NodeJS-Sample-App
    Note that all changes are already committed and pushed to repository. No need to push it yourself.
    Note that you have to stop previously started workspace, otherwise it will fails to start because of services conflicts
